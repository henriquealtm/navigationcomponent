# Navigation Component Samples

Sample project for different usages of Android Navigation Component. The current samples are:

  - Simple Navigation
  - Nested Navigation
  - BottomNavigationView
  - Custom Back Navigation
  - Back navigation returning value
  - Opening fragment from dynamic feature
  - Deep Link with a shortcut (implicit)
  - Deep Link with Notification (explicit)
  - Default navigation animations
  - Navigation with shared element transitions

Next samples to be implemented

  - Kotlin DSL Graph
  - Finish the graph and go back to an specific fragment

## Sample Installation problems
If there is an error while trying to install the app more than once, try to:

- Update the AS to the 4.1.1 version
- OR Set the `Run/Debug Configurations` of the Android Studio, in  the `Installation Options`, the `Deploy` value to `APK from app bundle`. This will avoid problems in the app installation in your device, that can happen by working with a dynamic feature in the project.
